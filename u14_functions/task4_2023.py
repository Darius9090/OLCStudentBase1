# Save the program as CHECK_LIST_2023_<your name>_<centre number>_<index number>.py [7 marks] 

# Extend the program by writing another function check_list() that searches 
# through the list of words to find a certain word. If it finds the word in the list, 
# it returns "Yes", otherwise it returns "No".  

# The variable word needs to be passed to the function.  

# The function you write must use the function split_sentence() already provided. 

# Save your program. 
# friends = ["john", "mary","nate"]
# name=input("Enter a name: ")
# if name in friends:
#     print(f"{name} is your friend")
# else:
#     print(f"{name} is not ur friend"

#     # split the sentence into a list
#     listsentence = split_sentence(sentence)

#     if word in listsentence:
#         return "Yes"
#     else:
#         return "No"
